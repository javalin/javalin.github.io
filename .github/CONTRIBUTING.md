## Creating an issue

Remember to include enough information if you're reporting a bug.  
Creating an issue to ask a question is fine.

## Creating a PR

Every PR will be considered.

### How to increase the chance of having your PR merged

* Ask about the feature beforehand (or pick one of the open issues)
* If no issue exists, create an issue for the PR
* Format your code so it looks somewhat like the rest of the source
