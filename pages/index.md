## REST API Simplicity
Javalin started as a fork of the [Spark](http://sparkjava.com) framework but quickly
turned into a ground-up rewrite influenced by [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [koa.js](http://koajs.com/).
All of these web frameworks are inspired by the modern micro web framework
grandfather: [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/), so if you're coming from Ruby then
Javalin shouldn't feel *too* unfamiliar.

Javalin is currently not aiming to be a full "web framework", but rather
just a very lightweight REST API library. There is no websocket support or concept of MVC,
but there is support for template engines and static file serving for convenience.
That way you can use Javalin to both create your RESTful API backend, as well as serve
an `index.html` and static resources (in case you're creating an SPA). This can be practical
if you don't want to deploy to apache or nginx in addition to your Javalin service.

If you wish to use Javalin to create web-pages instead of just REST APIs,
there are some simple template engine wrappers available for a quick and easy setup.

## Fully Fluent API
All the methods on the Javalin instance return `this`, making the API fully fluent. 
This will let you create a declarative and predictive REST API, 
that will be very easy to reason about for new developers joining your project. Javalin
is at its best when you declare the whole application config and the full REST API
in your `public static void main` method.

## Works well with both Java and Kotlin
The name Javalin comes from <b>Java</b> and Kot<b>lin</b>, and is meant 
to be used with both Java and Kotlin. The library itself is written in a mix of
Java and Kotlin in order to achieve the best interoperability between the two languages.
Javalin is intended as a "foot in the door" to Kotlin development for companies
that already write a lot of Java, and anyone can easily set up a microservice REST API in
Kotlin and try it out.  
Go through the [Kotlin REST API tutorial](/tutorials/simple-kotlin-example)
to see how to setup Kotlin with Maven, and how to use it with Javalin.

## Embedded Web-server
Javalin has an embedded web-server (jetty). This means that you can write your entire
application in Javalin, and deploy it as a fat jar. There is currently no support 
for adding Javalin as a servlet to an external container, but this is being considered. \\
Pull requests for other embedded server would be welcome (netty, undertow, etc).
