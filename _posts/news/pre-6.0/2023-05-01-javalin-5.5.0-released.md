## Javalin 5.5.0 has been released!

This release adds support for multi-instance plugins, and a private config option to handle `java.lang.Error` in handlers.
Some fixes include a fix for incorrect logging for missing access manager, eof/timeout handling in main exception handler path, and a fix for the Java api and naming of the Micrometer plugin.
We've also moved to the latest version of Kotlin, Jetty, Jackson, slf4j, okhttp and logback.
