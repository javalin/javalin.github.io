## Micrometer is back (baby)!

The Micrometer team has managed to get Micrometer ready for Jetty 11,
which allows us to bring back the plugin. This is distributed in the `javalin-micrometer` artifact.

The plugin can be enabled like this:

{% capture java %}
Javalin.create(config -> {
    config.plugins.register(
        MicrometerPlugin.create(metrics -> {
            metrics.registry = meterRegistry;
            metrics.tags = Tags.empty();
            metrics.tagExceptionName = true;
            metrics.tagRedirectPaths = tagRedirectPaths;
            metrics.tagNotFoundMappedPaths = tagNotFoundMappedPaths;
        })
    );
});
{% endcapture %}
{% capture kotlin %}
Javalin.create { config ->
    config.plugins.register(
        MicrometerPlugin.create { metrics ->
            metrics.registry = meterRegistry
            metrics.tags = Tags.empty()
            metrics.tagExceptionName = true
            metrics.tagRedirectPaths = tagRedirectPaths
            metrics.tagNotFoundMappedPaths = tagNotFoundMappedPaths
        }
    )
}
{% endcapture %}
{% include macros/docsSnippet.html java=java kotlin=kotlin %}

## SseClient features and fixes
We've added a `terminated()` function to the `SseClient`. This function will return true
if the connection has been terminated, either by the user calling `SseClient#close()`, or by
the remote client disconnecting.

We've also fixed a bug where `SseClient#close` was called every time `SseClient#send`
was called on a closed connection.

## Other changes since 5.1.0

* Fix welcome files for static files when pre-compression is enabled
* Support order in `submitTask` API (request lifecycle)
* Support "prefer405over404" option in `CorsPlugin`
* Use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` in `testtools`

* Expose fields and methods from `ConcurrencyUtil`
* Support plugins initialization in `Javalin#updateConfig`
* Move "Created but not started" to `JavalinLogger#startup`
